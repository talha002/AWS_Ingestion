# AWS Ingestion Services

This repo is created to show how to setup and use AWS ingestion services such as Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) and Kinesis. Within examples you will see some basic services like EC2 computing services and IAM Roles as well, if you having hard times with grasping it you can check out my repo about [AWS Basics](https://github.com/talha002/AWS_Basics) and [AWS Storage](https://github.com/talha002/AWS_Storage). All documents are taken from Erkan Åžirin's [AWS Data Engineering training](https://bootcamp.veribilimiokulu.com/bootcamp-programlari/aws-cloud-data-engineering-bootcamp/).

If you want to know more about these services follow my medium and check-out my article about [AWS Data Engineering: Data Ingestion Services](https://medium.com/@talha002/aws-data-engineering-data-ingestion-services-cf5d4e4109a5).
